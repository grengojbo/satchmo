Satchmo Migrations and Upgrades
===============================

The latest list of backwards incompatible changes can always be found here-
http://bitbucket.org/chris1610/satchmo/wiki/BackwardsIncompatibleChanges

The ideal way to migrate would be to dump all of your existing store data, remove all of your old tables, synch the new models and reload the data.
If this process is not practical, then follow the individual steps outlined below.

Always remember to do a complete backup of your store before attempting to migrate.  Additionally, we recommend that you test the migration
on a test server before attempting on a production server.

Using South
-----------

The very latest version of Satchmo includes migration files for `South <http://south.aeracode.org/>`_.
Initially, they will only include changes for the migration from 0.9 -> 0.9.1 but we will also continue to use
South for future migrations.

The basic workflow for executing migrations is:

    - Add south to INSTALLED_APPS
    - Install history table::

        python manage.py syncdb

    - "Fake" the initial migration::

        python manage.py migrate <satchmo_app> --fake 0001_initial

    - See list of migrations::

        python manage.py migrate --list

    - Run the migrations::

        python manage.py migrate <satchmo_app> --db-dry-run # db untouched
        python manage.py migrate <satchmo_app>
