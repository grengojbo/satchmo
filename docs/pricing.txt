Pricing
=======

Satchmo has flexible pricing that allows you to price at multiple levels.

Pricing at the Item Level
-------------------------

You can create top-level Products, which are the things your customers see on the website. (Ex: Python Rocks shirt in demo store)
Additionally, these products can have options (Ex: sizes, colors, etc).  The product has a variation for each combination of options. 
This can be used to track inventory of particular product variations. (Ex: The Large, Blue, Python Rocks Shirt)

Effectively it works like:
Product + Option = Variation

Pricing fits into the picture this way:
 * You can set a default price on your Product.
 * You can set a price adjustment for an option.
 * You can set a price over-ride for a variation.

The price code looks through these backwards. If the variation has a price then that is used
Otherwise the Product price is used +/- the adjustment for the chosen options (IE: XL shirts are +$1.00)

With this capability, you can quickly price a simple store by just using the product prices, and possibly adding price adjustments for specific options, 
but you have the option of very fine-grained price control by setting prices for each variation.

Product Variation Prices
------------------------

On the product variations, the price can have an expiration date and/or a quantity. 
If either of these fields are set then that price is only effective for orders placed before that date, or >= that quantity. 
The most specific of these gets highest priority (IE: the soonest expiration date, and the highest applicable quantity). 
This useful for running temporary promotions that automatically expire.
