Satchmo Trunk
===================

New Features
------------

Satchmo Trunk includes many new features and improvements. Some of the highlights are:

    - New most popular, best sellers and recently added views
    - New tiered shipping module based on quantity
    - New Fedex shipping module
    - New optional app "satchmo.upsell" which allows product upselling on product detail pages
    - New signals in get_qty_price methods of products, allowing code to manipulate the price returned by the function.  Example code using these signals is at satchmo.contrib.cartqty_discounts, which modifies the qty_discount method to calculate the discount based on the total number of items in the cart, rather than the total amount of the lineitem.
    - Improved inheritance of detail_producttype.html pages, which no longer need to duplicate as much of the code of base_product.html, allowing for easier addition of features to the product detail pages.
    - Migrated to newforms admin which fixed some bugs and provides a much more solid base for future changes
