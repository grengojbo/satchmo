============
Installation
============

This guide assumes that Django is properly installed and that you have installed the
dependencies mentioned in the requirements section.

1. Get the latest Satchmo production source release::

        svn co svn://satchmoproject.com/satchmo/tags/0.6
             or download from
        http://www.satchmoproject.com/snapshots/satchmo-0.6.tar.gz


.. Note::
    If you would like the latest bleading edge release, get it via svn-
	    svn co svn://satchmoproject.com/satchmo/trunk/
        
2. Ensure that satchmo is on your pythonpath.  There are several options for adding Satchmo to the path:
	
	- Add satchmo to the PYTHONPATH variable
	- Create a .pth file in your site-packages directory. pth_.
	- Install Satchmo in the site-packages directory

Either way, once it's done, you should be able to do this successfully::

	$ python
	Python 2.4.2 (#1, Feb  9 2006, 05:29:30)
	[GCC 3.4.4 (Gentoo 3.4.4-r1, ssp-3.4.4-1.0, pie-8.7.8)] on linux2
	Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
	>>> import django
	>>> import satchmo
	>>>

Do not attempt to progress any further on the install until the above imports
work.

The next two steps depend on whether or not Satchmo is a standalone project or
just an app that is part of another Django project.

If Satchmo is a standalone app (follow steps 3 and 4):

3.  Modify Satchmo's default settings-customize.py file::

        cp settings-customize.py settings.py
    
4.  Modify settings.py to reflect your setup.

If Satchmo is part of another Django app (follow step 5):

5. Modify you project settings.py file so that it has the following line at the end::

        from local_settings import *

Now that the basic application settings are complete, you will need to
configure the satchmo specific items stored in local_settings.py.

6.  Create your customized local_settings.py file::
    
        cp local_settings-customize.py local_settings.py

7.  Edit this local_settings.py file for your setup. The following values need to be changed::

        DATABASE_NAME = 'Your DB Name Here'
        DATABASE_PASSWORD = 'Your DB Password Here'
        DATABASE_USER = 'Your DB User Here'
        SECRET_KEY = 'Your secret key here'
        
        Any other values that are applicable to your setup

.. warning::
    The next step can erase data in the satchmo database. Be sure to have a backup of any critical data.

8.  Load the sample data::

        python load_data.py
    
9.  When prompted, enter Yes to all the questions.  This script will also install the i18n data.

10.  Start up the sample webserver to see your store::

        python manage.py runserver
        
11.  In order to see your sample store, point your browser to::
    
        http://localhost/shop to see your store

12.  If you want to see the admin interface, point your browser to::

        http://localhost/admin

.. note::
    The above urls will be dependent on your Django setup.  If you're running the webserver on the
    same machine you're developing on, the above urls should work.  If not, use the appropriate url.
