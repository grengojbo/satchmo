product_upsell
---------------------------------

Allows for easy upselling or cross-selling of a product. Up-selling can imply selling something additional, or selling something that is more profitable or otherwise preferable for the seller instead of the original sale [#]_ .

A practical example would be If you were selling ebooks, you could make a checkbox on the ebook detail page, which would allow your customer to order the companion CD. This is useful as you are able to provide customers with a direct way of purchasing a companion item without the need to search for it.

	
	Usage::
	
		{% product_upsell product %}

		
This tag renders another template using the ``django.template.Library().inclusion_tag`` library. The tag should be used within a html form, most commonly within the order form for the product you want to upsell.


.. note::
   Currently, the goal product doesn't have any options.  It can be a be a product variation, but can't be a configurable product by itself.
