Shipping Module Activation
--------------------------

Satchmo provides you the flexibility to enable and disable as many shipping modules
as you would like.  Since everyone has different needs for shipping, there's a simple
but powerful way to define your own shipping modules.

Activate and configure your shipping modules from your site settings page.  Usually this is at
SHOP_BASE/settings/.  You can also access this page from the ``Edit Shop Options`` link on your 
main admin home page.

.. Note::
    If you have custom modules you would like to add, make sure it is added to your
    ``CUSTOM_SHIPPING_MODULES`` list in your local_settings.py file

Available Modules
-----------------

Satchmo includes several modules in the default distribution.

Dummy
+++++

This module is mainly included in order to demonstrate how you can create your own modules.  If
you have an interest in creating your own, copy this module to a new directory and use the comments
to guide you through the process.

Flat
++++

This is a very simple module that allows you to set a flat rate for all shipments.  It's not very 
sophisticated but it may be useful for simple stores or as a basis for other modules.  The values
can be configured through your settings page.

Per
+++

This module is a little bit more complex than the flat rate.  It allows you to set one rate that is
multiplied by the number of items in your order.  These values are configured through your settings 
page.

Tiered
++++++

This one is much more flexible than any of the prior modules, so it requires a little more configuration.  
It is not enabled by default. 

To enable:

 1. Add satchmo.shipping.modules.tiered to your settings.py INSTALLED_APPS and then run syncdb.
 2. Enable in site settings under "Active Shipping Modules"
 3. Configure using the administration page like you would a product.

Why bother?

Well, it allows you to set up multiple carriers, for one thing.  
For another, you can have different prices based on cart total (total of shippable items, to be specific).  
For another, it is multilingual from the start, with you being able to specify translations of carrier, 
method, etc. right in the admin pages.  Lastly, you can have shipping specials, expiring on the dates 
of your choice.

For example, you can make this shipping table::

    $0-$25   UPS=$8.50, Fedex=$18.00
    $25.01-$50 UPS=$9.75, Fedex=21.00
    ....
    $250.00 + free
