Shipping Module Activation
--------------------------

Satchmo provides you the flexibility to enable and disable as many shipping modules
as you would like.  Since everyone has different needs for shipping, there's a simple
but powerful way to define your own shipping modules.

Activate and configure your shipping modules from your site settings page.  Usually this is at
SHOP_BASE/settings/
