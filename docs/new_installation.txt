============
Installation
============

This guide is the Satchmo installation process. It is meant to be a cookbook approach for
most users. Advanced users may wish to modify this in order to integrate into their own projects. For the
truly impatient, you may look at the :doc:`Quick Start <quickstart>` for the fastest way to get a store up and
running.

This guide assumes you are working on a unix variant and that you are installing it somewhere into a directory
you have write access to. In the below example, we use /home/user/src. You are expected to modify the path to fit your needs.

.. warning::
   You must have Django 1.1.x properly installed.

The easiest way to install satchmo requirements, is to use the python setuptools program to download egg and tar packages. The next section describes
one simple method to install the dependencies. You may manually install them if you wish.

A Quick Note About Installing Dependencies
------------------------------------------

Python allows you to install applications in multiple ways. Much of this is personal preference. For the purposes of this guide,
we will use either easy_install or python setup.py install to install most of the packages.

You may elect to use pip, manually link packages into your site-packages directory or use .pth files to add each to your
python path. All of these will work fine with Satchmo but in the interest of keeping this as straightforward as possible, we
are picking a small number of approaches that work across the maximum number of platforms.

Installing Dependencies
-----------------------

1. Install setuputils by following the instructions on the easy_install_ page. After installation, you should be able to run ``easy_install`` directly (assuming the install directory is in you $PATH).

2. Install required dependencies (this may vary based on your OS of choice)::

        easy_install pycrypto
        easy_install http://www.satchmoproject.com/snapshots/trml2pdf-1.2.tar.gz
        easy_install django-registration
        easy_install PyYAML

.. note::
    If you have Python 2.4 installed, you will need to install elementtree also::

        easy_install elementtree

3. Install Python Imaging Library. There are multiple options for installing this application. Please use 1 of the options below::

    - Download the binary from the PIL `site <http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/>`_ and install.

    - Use your distribution's package manager. For Ubuntu::

        sudo apt-get install python-imaging

4. Install Reportlab based on the description for your OS `here <http://www.reportlab.com/software/opensource/rl-toolkit/download/>`_ 

5. Install django-threaded-multihost:

   - Check out from source::

       hg clone http://bitbucket.org/bkroeze/django-threaded-multihost/
       cd /path/to/django-threaded-multihost
       python setup.py install

6. Install django-app-plugins:

   - Check out the satchmo-enhanced version::

       hg clone http://bitbucket.org/bkroeze/django-caching-app-plugins/
       cd /path/to/django-caching-app-plugins
       python setup.py install

7. Install sorl-thumbnail:

   - Check out from source::

       hg clone https://sorl-thumbnail.googlecode.com/hg/ sorl-thumbnail
       cd /path/to/sorl-thumbnail
       python setup.py install

8. Install signals-ahoy:

   - Check out from source::

       hg clone http://bitbucket.org/bkroeze/django-signals-ahoy/
       cd /path/to/django-signals-ahoy
       python setup.py install

9. Install livesettings:

   - Check out from source::

       hg clone http://bitbucket.org/bkroeze/django-livesettings/
       cd /path/to/djang-livesettings
       python setup.py install


10. Install keyedcache:

   - Check out from source::

       hg clone http://bitbucket.org/bkroeze/django-keyedcache/
       cd /path/to/django-keyedcache
       python setup.py install

Satchmo has two types of documentation. Sphinx is used to generate this document.
Docutils are useful for the auto-generated admin documentation. You may choose to
install these dependencies.

11. Optional documentation dependencies::

     easy_install Sphinx
     easy_install docutils

12. Satchmo also uses South for database migrations. You may also install it::

     easy_install South
    
.. note::
    Please note that all dependencies can be installed manually. Please visit the requirements_ page for details. Also, provided egg and tar files may not be the most current installation, so you should ensure that the
    recommended satchmo version is available via ``easy_install`` before proceeding.

Installing Satchmo into your path
---------------------------------

1. Checkout the latest Satchmo release into (/home/user/src)::

        hg clone http://bitbucket.org/chris1610/satchmo/

.. note::
   If you are a bitbucket user, you may see a slightly different url than described above.
   You may use the generic url or one that is specific to your username. For the purposes
   of an install, either will work.

2. Install satchmo onto your system::

        cd /home/user/src/satchmo-trunk
        sudo python setup.py install

.. note::
   An alternative to running the install is ensuring that /path/to/satchmo/apps is on your python path.
   You may do this by placing a symbolic link to the source, adding a .pth file that points to your /satchmo/apps
   location or modifying your PYTHONPATH environment variable.


3. Once the above step is completed, you should be able to import both django and satchmo::

        $ python
        Python 2.5.2 (r252:60911, Mar 12 2008, 13:39:09)
        [GCC 4.2.3 (Ubuntu 4.2.3-2ubuntu4)] on linux2
        Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
        >>> import django
        >>> import satchmo_store
        >>> satchmo_store.get_version()
        '0.9-pre hg-YYYY:ZZZZZZZZZZ'

.. warning::
   Do not attempt to progress any further on the install until the above imports work.
   
.. _clonesatchmo:

Build Your Store With clonesatchmo
----------------------------------

In order to quickly get you up and running, satchmo includes a helper script that will
get a new sample store up and running quickly.

1. Build a starter store using clonesatchmo::

    python /home/user/src/satchmo-trunk/scripts/clonesatchmo.py

The clonesatchmo program will do everything described in :doc:`settings`. At a high level it:

    * Creates a directory for your store (defaults to simplestore)
    * Also creates a localsite directory for your customizations (defaults to localsite)
    * Copies a valid settings.py and local_settings.py file
    * Copies your static directory in place
    * Copies a valid urls.py file
    * Synchs your database (using sqlite)
    * Loads l10n data
    * Loads a sample store
    
Using this process is the recommended way to get your store up and running. Once you are comfortable with 
this store, you can dive into modifying your :doc:`settings` file or making other changes.

View the Demo Store
-------------------

After you have completed your initial install, you can check out your demo store
using the commands below.

1.  Start up the sample webserver to see your store::

        python manage.py runserver

2.  In order to see your sample store, point your browser to::

        http://127.0.0.1:8000/shop or http://127.0.0.1/

3.  If you want to see the admin interface, point your browser to::

        http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin

4.  Many configuration and customization settings are accessed through the url::

        http://127.0.0.1:8000/settings

5.  Additional detailed documentation can be found here::

        http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/doc

.. note::
    The above urls will be dependent on your Django setup.  If you're running the webserver on the
    same machine you're developing on, the above urls should work.  If not, use the appropriate url.

Troubleshooting
---------------

If after following these steps, you have errors or can not get the store to work, satchmo includes a custom
command to check your system's configuration. To check your system out::

    python manage.py satchmo_check
    Checking your satchmo configuration.
    Your configuration has no errors.

Additional Notes
----------------

Satchmo also includes a full set of unit tests. After you get your system installed, you can run the unit tests with this command::

        python manage.py test
