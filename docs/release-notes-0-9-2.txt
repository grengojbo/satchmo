Migration Notes

CSRF
++++
As of `rev 1999 <http://bitbucket.org/chris1610/satchmo/changeset/a624c8018f52>`_, Satchmo supports the newest Django 1.2 Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
protection. You are encouraged to read more about it int the `Django docs <http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/csrf/>`_

If you have an existing Satchmo store and need to support CSRF, you will need to do a couple of things:

    1. Upgrade to Django 1.2.1 or greater
    2. Ensure 'django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware' is in your MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES
    3. Ensure that any forms in your custom templates, have {% csrf_token %} inside the <form> element
    
Messages
++++++++
As of `rev 1999 <http://bitbucket.org/chris1610/satchmo/changeset/a624c8018f52>`_, Satchmo incorporates some of the components of the new `messages framework <http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/messages/>`_.

If you have an existing Satchmo store you will need to:

    1. Add 'django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware' to your MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES
    2. Add 'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages' to your TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS
    3. Add 'django.contrib.messages' to your INSTALLED_APPS setting
